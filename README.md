There are many GAN variants, this tutoral is to understand the math behind the various variants of GAN and its implementation of source code with different open datasets. 

GAN- Generative Adversrial Network 

DCGAN - Deep Convolutional Generative Adversrial Network 

CGAN - COnditional Generative Adversrial Network 

CycleGAN

CoGAN- Coupled Generative Adversrial Network 

ProGAN - Prograssive Generative Adversrial Network 

WGAN- Wasserstein Generative Adversrial Network 

ACGAN- Auxillary Generative Adversrial Network
